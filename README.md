## P2P database for scalable applications
Peerbit is as easy-to-use as Firebase and provide P2P functionality like OrbitDB or GunJS yet with performance for data-intensive applications like live-streaming and cloud-gaming. It's built on top of Libp2p (and works with IPFS) supporting encryption, sharding and discoverability (searching). 

Your database schema can remain very simple but still utilize P2P networks, auto-scaling, E2E-encryption, discoverability and all other features you'd expect from a database.
